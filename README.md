# chat-emojifier-mod-1.19
Minecraft Mod for v1.19+ to emojify your chat with random emojis
## Usage
This mod adds 3 chat modes:
* NONE - you send normal messages in chat but still can see emojis.
* EMOJI - if you type somethinf in chat(not the /msg command or similar commands) your message will be mixed with random emojis.
* CENSORED - similar to EMOJI mode, but uses much less emojis. Use this mode if server you are playing on does NOT support unicode-emojis.

To switch between modes there's a custom N-keybind which you can bind to different key.

If you don't want to use this mod, but still want to see emojis, you can use [this resourcepack](https://github.com/Oceangrad/Oceangrad-censored-emoji-resourcepack).
